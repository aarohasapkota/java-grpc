# gRPC Learning Journey (Java)

This repository serves as my personal learning space for exploring and implementing gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) in Java. I'm following a structured course, and this repo will contain code examples, exercises, and projects as I progress through the material.

## Course Outline & Progress

Below is an overview of the topics covered in the course and my current progress. Each chapter's folder will contain the relevant code and notes.

* **Chapter 1: gRPC Course Overview**
    * *Status:* Complete ✅
* **Chapter 2: [Theory] gRPC Internals Deep Dive**
    * *Status:* Complete ✅
* **Chapter 3: [Hands-On] gRPC Project Overview & Setup**
    * *Status:* Complete ✅
* **Chapter 4: [Hands-On] gRPC Unary**
    * *Status:* Complete ✅
* **Chapter 5: [Hands-On] gRPC Server Streaming**
    * *Status:* 19m remaining
* **Chapter 6: [Hands-On] gRPC Client Streaming**
    * *Status:* 37m remaining
* **Chapter 7: [Hands-On] gRPC Bi-Directional Streaming**
    * *Status:* 23m remaining
* **Chapter 8: [Hands-On] gRPC Advanced Features Deep Dive**
    * *Status:* 57m remaining
* **Chapter 9: [Hands-On] CRUD API with MongoDB**
    * *Status:* 1h 8m remaining

## Technologies Used

* **Java:** The primary programming language.
* **gRPC:** For building high-performance, distributed applications.
* **Gradle:** (Likely) for build automation and dependency management.
* **MongoDB:** (For Chapter 9) A NoSQL database.

## How to Run the Code

Each chapter's directory will likely contain its own `README.md` or instructions on how to build and run the specific examples. Generally, you'll need:

1.  **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure you have a compatible JDK installed.
2.  **Maven or Gradle:** Depending on the project setup.
